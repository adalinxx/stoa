// Media kept for good, paid for with this device's work: a storage sponsor
// (0xLattice/lattice-sponsor run with --sell-storage) pins a file's Volume on
// its node once work it hands out covers the file's bytes. No key and no
// coins: the page uploads the Volume, grinds the sponsor's shares, and the
// sponsor pins it. The sponsor is trusted for keeping the file only; every
// reader checks the bytes against the CID.
//
//   POST /store {root, volumes}   → {root, bytes, needed, credit, stored}
//   POST /work  {client?, chain, store: root} → a nonce range and its share target
//   POST /shares {assignment, nonce} → accepted, or refused by name
//   GET  /store/:root             → the upload's status; stored once pinned
//   GET  /terms                   → {storageRates: {"<chain>": bytesPerCoin}, ...}
